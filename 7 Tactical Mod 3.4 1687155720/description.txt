2.9a
UCP and 5x updates for AI tech prefs and reworked antarans.

2.8 Changes:
Bug fixes, blueprint fixes, balance tweaks to Phasors and a few specials. Updates to planetary defense bleuprints and AI preferences for building them.

2.7 Changes:
Tweaks to weapons and defensive specials. Bug fixes for AI blueprints. Firing arcs reduced to 90 degrees per quadrant from 120 degrees. Minor balance tweaks to weapons and specials.

2.6 Additions:
Tweaks to balance between cannons/beams/missiles. Base energy accuracy changed from 25 to 0 to make cannon/beam accuracy increase more gradually. This change boosts races with beam attack bonuses and increases the value of the Battle Scanner and advanced computers.

Missile attack has increased to give them a better base accuracy and missile HP have been adjusted to make early game point defenses weaker and late game point defense more powerful. ECM has seen significant boosts to make and should be more valuable.

Multiphased Shields increased to 175% base hull. These shields just weren't that great compared to hard shields.

Minor adjustments to defenses. Range boost reduced so ships aren't immediately under fire. Damage and accuracy boosted to compensate.

2.5 Additions:
Second pass on cannons and beams. Adjustments have been made to add back in differing accuracies and a few cooldown periods adjusted. First pass on missiles. Missiles now take 15 space and have 15s cooldowns along with increased damage. The goal is to make missiles more of a standoff volley weapon. High upfront damage, low rate of fire.

Other tweaks:
All torpedoes got a slight speed boost but accelerate slower. Should make them more useful.
Inertial Stabilizer and Nullifier significantly reduced. Their avoidance was so high even late game computers missed most of the time.
All missile attack ratings decreased. ECM should now be a viable alternative and scale better late game.
Fighters adjusted a bit to make them less overwhelming.
Pulsar and Lightning field tweaked.
Futher adjustments to shields. Overall increase in strength but less gain for each shield level. Multiphased shields now give 150% base hull value additional shields. Hopefully makes them a bit more attractive compared to hard shields.


2.0 Additions:
This update fixes a few balance issues with weapons and implements phase two. Phase two is the first pass redesign of ship blueprint templates and fleet composition for Alkari, Bulrathi, Darlok, Human, Klackon, Meklar, Mrrshan, Psilon, Sakkra, Silicoid, Elerian, Gnolam, and Trilarian. This update allows these races to take advantage of the weapons changes the mod makes. You can expect to see favorite weapons technologies, favorite special equipment, fleet composition, and maybe a few other surprises geared to make the AI ships more challenging to fight and requiring different strategies to combat different races.

Global changes:
All ship classes have reduced turning an get less speed benefit from better drives in tactical combat the larger they are. This results in more variance between classes and situations where small, fast ships can evade larger slow ones.

Size costs for arcs has increased significantly. All around weapons should significantly affect the total firepower you can mount on a ship for the advantage of never having to turn. They are currently set to 125% for left/right and 250% for all around arcs.

Armor resilience max reduction has been increased to 75% damage reduction from 25%. This gives added benefit to armor and weapons that ignore resilience as the game progresses.

Shields have been adjusted to reduce damage mitigation. The amount of mitigation matches the shield class. Overall shield amounts have been tweaked a bit. Even early game weapons can overcome their mitigation until you hit class VII or X shields.

Shipbuilding changes:
I've normalized space requirements for beams and cannon weapons. This is in response to overall changes in how these weapons perform and to make it easier to adapt your ships as needed. Weapons are now grouped as "classes" with the size requirements for a class being the same. The general result is that a modded weapon can compete with an unmodded new unlock making weapons viable longer.

Weapons Changes:
The goal with weapons changes is to make them have more tactical variety so that weapons aren't just about unlocking a stat boost. This means some weapons can last far into a game upgraded with mods. It also means that weapons utility can change a lot based on the situation. For example, Graviton doesn't do a good job taking down shields, but it ignores resilience damage reduction and has very high AP making it very dangerous against unshield ships even late game.

All cannons and beams now fall off to 75% of their total damage. The exceptions are weapons with 2x dissipation that are reduced to 50% of their total damage and weapons with no dissipation that have 100% damage at range.

All cannons now falloff faster closer to max range making them more powerful farther away.

All beams now fall off more evenly throughout their entire range making them lose effectiveness at a higher rate than cannons. This makes them more powerful the closer you are to the firing ship.

Beam weapons have had significant changes in how they function. Instead of multiple small hits, each beam now does one single hit for higher damage. This makes them better against shield damage mitigation and allows for specials like Plasma Beam to get 4x hits like Moo2.

Individual weapon damages, ap, and weapon mods allowed have been significantly reworked for beams and cannons. Damage reduction helps to make ships feel tougher across the board without having to edit each ship to add more HP and makes tactical a bit more forgiving of mistakes. Weapons now mimic MOO2 with what mods are allowed and, where possible, how they work.
