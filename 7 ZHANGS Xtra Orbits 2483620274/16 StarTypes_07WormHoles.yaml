# Xpanded Xtra Orbits - PLANET / ORBIT CONFIGURATION - WORM HOLES
# by MeVII
# *****
# ***** 5/09/21
# ***** This file is the seperated listing of planet & orbit configuration
# ***** for a single system type taken out from StarTypes.yaml
# ***** You can select which system type use the modified / default settings
# ***** by keeping / removing its file from this folder
# *****
# ***** After the number of OBJECTS is selected by PlanetaryDensityPackages.yaml
# ***** then orbits are filled according to orbitChances parameters
# ***** First it will roll % and select the orbit for the 1st, then 2nd etc... object
# ***** The total must = 100
# ***** 
# ***** After it selects what orbit to fill it decides what to fill the orbit with
# ***** The total of planetChance + asteroidFieldChance + gasGiantChance must do NOT need to = 100
# ***** multipleObjectChance only affects asteroids and can place 2 asteroids in one orbit
# *****
# ***** Lastly it sets the mineral_richness for the object according to a % roll
# ***** The total must = 100
# *****
# ***** Final Note - If I dont comment on it is either obvious or I dont know about it
