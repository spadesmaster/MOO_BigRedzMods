- Known Bugs
-----------------
01 - The Klackon
02 - Adding extra orbits to a system strains the games galaxy creation processing.
A circular Brobdinagarian very dense galaxy with 8 AIs, monsters,
and minor civs, which according to the game log file had 300 and 1157 stars
takes my system* ~5min. (AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core - 32GB)
Even more complex galaxies such as 5Xs Irrelgular, can take even longer,
or crash. If that happens, just try again.
(It’s a good idea to take note of galaxy seeds that do and do not work.)
03 - There was a very -very- large amount of cross connective data
to keep track of for all the charts.
I was diligent in checking for accuracy, but, the likelihood of there being errors
(in the graphs) from copying the data from the yamls into all of the graphs, is high.

_______________________________
- Summary
-------------------------------

This mod is a detailed and comprehensive overhaul of a large portion of system spawn metrics.

It also fully expands possible orbits from 5 to 7
and is fully integrated into all aspects of additional 5X content added by WhatIsSol.

Star and Biome chances for both Galaxy Age and Galaxy Density
Planet Sizes, Number of Orbits, Number of Planets, Mineral Richness,
and AI Planet Ratings have all been meticulously reworked.

The data and changes would be far too much to list or explain.
There is a very large quantity of graphs with fully itemized data-tables
presented in the image list on the Steam Workshop page for this mod.

- Compatibility Information
-------------------------------

This Mod requires UCP, 5X, and UCP5X Compatibility mods.
(It will function without Custom 5X and DSMP Assets,
however, some game images will be blank)
It should always be loaded after (below) UCP, 5X, and UCP5X Compatibility mods.

Files Modified | Globals.yaml | PlanetRating.yaml | GalaxyAges.yaml | BiomeChances.yaml
PlanetSizeChances.yaml | PlanetaryDensityPackages.yaml | StarTypes.yaml | PlanetSizeTypes.yaml

-> It will conflict with / overwrite this information
of any mod loaded before (above) this mod loads.

Mod Details - Xpanded Xtra Orbits
----------------------------------
See graphs displayed on the Steam mod page showing a full break down.
Below is a summary of the largest changes and differences...

- Orbits increased from 5 to 7.

- Every standard biome has a 2% chance to be each of its uber-biomes.

- Star Type determines biomes present, not galaxy age.
The star is its age because of the galaxys age,
and so planets have the biomes they do because of
the star that governs their home system.
-- Biome chances are identical for Very Young, Young,
Average, Old and Very Old Galaxy ages.
Very Lush, Lush, Sparse and Very Sparse settings while in the drop down for galaxy age,
are not "Ages", and so, I have set biome chances for those separately.

! IMPORTANT NOTE !
For the Very Lush, Lush, Sparse and Very Sparse settings
I still follow the *character* of the star.
White stars are not flooded with gaia planets in Lush.
Yellow Stars are not surrounded by barren planets for Sparse.
(See posted charts)

- Biome possibilities have been brought sharply into line with the description of the star.
- Almost all data now follows a cascading linearly progressive shift.
In some cases I even created spreadsheet formulas to auto calculate / distribute percentiles.
(You really are going to want to spend time looking at the charts.)
- Im a sucker for extremes and bell-curves. Options are now more sharply contrasted,
while at the same time distribution is nearly always set into a bell-curve.
- Biomes follow the "character" of the star. From the hotest and youngest blue-white star,
to the coldest and oldest red stars.
-- Blue-whites = hot, harsh and burned away planets.
-- Whites = Minimaly cooler, and so very slightly shifted in that direction.
-- Yellow = Much more mild, few harsh planets.
-- Orange = Very mild, nothing but habitable planets.
-- Red = Once orange stars, now much older, have expanded in size considerable.
So have done significant damage to planets that have not have their atmospheres burned away.
-- Brown - Brown stars are very rare and very old.
All planets are gone, possibly scavenged for resources by whatever long forgotten race,
when they transcended to a new different dimension,
and left behind a single planet that they terraformed into a uber-biome.
-- Black Holes are mysterious, and odd anomalies can occur
where space and time are under such extreme conditions.
There is a 10% chance that an uber-biome will spawn in a black hole system.
Uber gaia planets can now spawn in black hole systems.
(Psudo-Lore : Orions were studying black holes from the planet.)
-- Worm Holes can now spawn a planet.
The vast amount of unstable energies assures such planets will be intensely uninhabitable.
There is a very slim chance that a Cybernetic planet will be in a wormhole system.
(Psudo-Lore : Someone was studying the worm hole from the planet.)

Closing Notes
--------------

In order to minimize crashes during galaxy generation, I have reduced the diameter of systems.
Then, to fit adding planets, while shrinking system diameters, I reduced the diameter of planets.
Thees chances are *visual* only. They have no impact on game mechanics.
There is no way to shrink the display size of asteroids. This would cause them to often cover planets.
To mitigate that, asteroid fields *are still present*, but *mostly* (not all) moved to outer orbits.

I have separated very nearly every attribute into its own individual yaml file.
This essentially makes this mod modable.
Simply remove / delete the items you dont want changed,
and they will revert to whatever settings are loaded before them.

I thoroughly organize and annotate yaml files in my mods.
VERY MUCH SO in this mod.
To the point that this mod could almost double as a tutorial!
Individuals are encouraged to look into the files located at
[DRIVE LETTER]:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\workshop\content\298050\2483620274
should be able to very easily modify the contents to suit their play style.
