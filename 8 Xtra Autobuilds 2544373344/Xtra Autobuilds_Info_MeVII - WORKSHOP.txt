******* Xtra Autobuild Structures - MeVII *******
v01.07.11.21.13.20

[h2][u]Summary[/u][/h2]
This mod alters all colony ships so that if the player has the Tech researched
they build a host of new structures when founding a new colony.
Colony ship building costs have been rebalanced.
Hyper Advanced Colony Ships are fully self-sufficient flying colonies
and so have reduced command point cost.

01 - The Klackon
02 - [BETA VERSION] READ THIS CAREFULLY -
This mod is NOT 100% functional without copying over a dll file with the one found in the mod folder. 

WITHOUT the dll, ALL buildings WILL be built - however, harsh planet buildings, that, for example
Change Toxic planets to Barren planets, will NOT CHANGE THE BIOME.

It is recommend to sell them for BC, to get a discount to just buy them back.

WITH THE INCLUDED DLL the buildings will ALSO CHANGE THE PLANET BIOME to Barren as they should.

HOWEVER, there is STILL a glitch where some effects, such as the visual rendering of the planetary shield will not occur until the game refreshes the buildings list, when a building is sold, or built.

WhatIsSol is looking at the issue, and he MAY fix it in a future UPC update.
If he does, then this mod will automatically function at 100%.
