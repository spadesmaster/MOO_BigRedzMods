SpudDastardly & WhatisSol for patiently dealing with my many nitpicky questions

- Known Bugs
-----------------
01 - The Klackon
02 - [BETA VERSION] READ THIS CAREFULLY -
This mod is NOT 100% functional without copying over a dll file with the one found in the mod folder. 

WITHOUT the dll, ALL buildings WILL be built - however, harsh planet buildings, that, for example
Change Toxic planets to Barren planets, will NOT CHANGE THE BIOME.

It is recommend to sell them for BC, to get a discount to just buy them back.

WITH THE INCLUDED DLL the buildings will ALSO CHANGE THE PLANET BIOME to Barren as they should.

HOWEVER, there is STILL a glitch where some effects, such as the visual rendering of the planetary shield will not occur until the game refreshes the buildings list, when a building is sold, or built.

WhatIsSol is looking at the issue, and he MAY fix it in a future UPC update.
If he does, then this mod will automatically function at 100%.

- Summary
-------------------------------

This mod alters all colony ships so that if the player has the Tech researched
they build a host of new structures when founding a new colony.
Colony ship building costs have been rebalanced.
Hyper Advanced Colony Ships are fully self-sufficient flying colonies
and so have reduced command point cost.

_______________________________
- Compatibility Information
-------------------------------

This Mod requires UCP, 5X, and UCP5X Compatibility mods.
(It will function without Custom 5X and DSMP Assets,
however, some game images will be blank)
It should always be loaded after (below) UCP, 5X, and UCP5X Compatibility mods.

--- Files Modified
The following yaml files are used by this mod.
