[h3][i]Known Bugs[/i][/h3]
01 - The Klackon
02 - Building Warp Gates on system bodies makes it impossible to click on that system body.

It is still possible to navagate to teh planet useing all other menus and methods.

[h2][u]Mod Details[/u][/h2]
I decided to name this mod Xtra Complex 4x based on following line of thought.
4X stands for eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate.
This mod makes all the decisions regarding the management and implementation of
each of those focuses more involved, by creating more interdependency and value to
many key structures. (See the image of the chart for full details at a glance.)
All Workship structures can now be built even in systems players don’t have a colony in.
However, many new balance metrics were implemented along with extra boosted benefits.
What do you want first? The Good News or the Bad News? Read in your preferred order.

[b][i]GOOD NEWS[/i][/b]
[spoiler]Upkeep for the Star Base, Battle Station and Star Fortress are lower.
Build cost for Star Fortress and Surveillance Stations is lower.
Surveillance Stations, Military and Adv Military Outposts
now create, not take up command points.
… can now repair ships, upgrade ships, and block star lanes.
… have the largest scanner boost of any structure in the game,
actually making it a consideration of building and keeping them for Surveillance.
…provide a +1/2/3 research bonus per turn.
Military and Adv Military Outposts have had both
their repair factor, and scanners boosted.
Asteroid Labs / mines and Gas Giant Mines… slightly repair ships every turn.
…can upgrade fleets.
Asteroid Labs have a +1 Scanner Boost.
Asteroid / Gas Giant mines have a +1 Research Bonus.
Asteroid Mines boosted from +10bc to +15bc.
Jump Gates can now be built at all planet and asteroid locations.
Jump Gates now reduce travel time by half.[/spoiler]

[b][i]BAD NEWS[/i][/b]
[spoiler]Build costs for the Star Base, Battle Station
and Star Fortress have been increased.
Command Point bonuses for the Star Base, Battle Station
and Star Fortress have been lowered.
Surveillance Stations have a higher upkeep.
Military and Adv Military Outposts now have a BC upkeep.
Asteroid Labs / mines and Gas Giant Mines… have higher build costs.
…have a command point cost of 1.
Jump Gates cost more and have a higher upkeep.[/spoiler]

[h2][u]Closing Notes[/u][/h2]
"Why cant Jump Gates just be built anywhere on Warp Nodes AND Planets?"
If the Tag "requiresWarpGate" is set to "false" to allow building on planets,
then they cant be built on warp gates(lanes/nodes) and visa versa.

I intend to write unique descriptions that indicate all the changes this mod makes,
to make everything more integrated and immersive. Sooner than later.
