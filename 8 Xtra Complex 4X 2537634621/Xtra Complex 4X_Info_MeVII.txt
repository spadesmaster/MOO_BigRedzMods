Mod Details - Xtra Complex 4X
-----------------------------
I decided to name this mod Xtra Complex 4x based on following line of thought.
4X stands for eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate.
This mod makes all the decisions regarding the management and implementation of
each of those focuses more involved, by creating more interdependency and value to
many key structures. (See the image of the chart for full details at a glance.)
All Workship structures can now be built even in systems players don’t have a colony in.
However, many new balance metrics were implemented along with extra boosted benefits.
What do you want first? The Good News or the Bad News? Read in your preferred order.

(Sorry...no spoiler effect in plain text version)

GOOD NEWS - GOOD NEWS - GOOD NEWS - GOOD NEWS - GOOD NEWS - GOOD NEWS
Upkeep for the Star Base, Battle Station and Star Fortress are lower.
Build cost for Star Fortress and Surveillance Stations is lower.
Surveillance Stations, Military and Adv Military Outposts
now create, not take up command points.
… can now repair ships, upgrade ships, and block star lanes.
… have the largest scanner boost of any structure in the game,
actually making it a consideration of building and keeping them for Surveillance.
…provide a +1/2/3 research bonus per turn.
Military and Adv Military Outposts have had both
their repair factor, and scanners boosted.
Asteroid Labs / mines and Gas Giant Mines… slightly repair ships every turn.

Asteroid Mines boosted from +10bc to +15bc.

Closing Notes
--------------
"Why cant Jump Gates just be built anywhere on Warp Nodes AND Planets?"
If the Tag "requiresWarpGate" is set to "false" to allow building on planets,
then they cant be built on warp gates(lanes/nodes) and visa versa.

I intend to write unique descriptions that indicate all the changes this mod makes,
to make everything more integrated and immersive. Sooner than later.
