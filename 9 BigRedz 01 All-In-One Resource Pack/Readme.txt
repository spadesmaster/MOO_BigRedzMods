## For now this just includes art assets for all of BigRedz mods
## but I expect to incorporate the other asset packs as well so new/returning
## players can skip a bunch of confusing installer steps

## For now it also includes MeVII's assets and his number-based rank graphics
## Will update readme when I get the other assets all included along with an installer

This mod is for they who prefer things very simple and straight forward.
The leader rank icons are now arranged and displayed in numerical ascending order.
This mod is only a cosmetic change to the [u]icons[/u] used for leader ranks.
It does not alter the gameplay in any way.
It does [i]not[/i] add extra ranks -  SpudDastardly added the additional ranks in 5X.
