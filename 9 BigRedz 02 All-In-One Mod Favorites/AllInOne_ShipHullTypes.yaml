#5X 6X BigRedz All-in-One Combo this mod should be loaded after all other mods (esp. Colony Base)
#This mod surgically changes just the values we want to tweak without repeating everything and potentially breaking other stuff

#Created 3-Apr Increased hull size of Bomb Ketch / Bomber Frigate to make it into a semi-useful hull
#Base normal Frigate can carry 6 bombs, Ketch with half the HP and worse handling can only carry 7?  9 seems more reasonable
