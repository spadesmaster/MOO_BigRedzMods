Mod MUST BE LOADED LAST IN YOUR MOD ORDER to override/correct any previous' mods changes

Tired of having so many tiny tweak mods cluttering your mod list?
Tired of having to fuss with the mod load order to get your game to work properly?
Not sure which of the popular old mods are no longer necessary/compatible with 5X/UCP/DSMP/TacticalMod?
Tired of casual mod developers overwriting/breaking other mods?
Want a clean updated version for each of your favorite tweak mods?

STANDARD 5X + BIGREDZ MOD LOAD ORDER:
1) 'Standard' 5X/UCP/DSMP mod order list: 5X, UCP, UCP Workshop, DSMP, 5XCPC

Complete list of mods included (or eliminated as unneccesary) and Change history below

29-Mar-2023 Created, custom race perk points to 25 (5 more than 5X), tweaked both ship/structure scrapping to 75% of original cost
			Added Speed Mod (vaaish) for faster ship/gate travel with expansion to support all 5X engines and tweaked values
30-Mar-2023 Added Battle Pods Revert (Mituna) for no cargo space cost pods but a little more expensive
			Added Both Tectonic (Mituna) so you get both critical endgame techs Core Mine and Core Dump even if not Creative
			Added Only Good Random Events (Mituna) which prevents bad events (is it still allowing Good ones?)
			Added Pollution Structs Boost (Mituna) which makes pollution structures a little more effective
			Added AI Cant Ignore (Spuds) so you can still try diplomacy with a race that doesn't like you
			Added Planet Max Pop +4 (Num7) which increases the max population limit on ALL size planets by 4
			Added Nerfed Antarans (BigRedz) which allows Antaran attacks but makes early ones much easier
			Added Outposts Anywhere (Steel) allows military outposts and jump gates to be built even in systems we haven't yet colonized a planet in for more strategic map control
			Added Rewards and Diplomacy Tweaks (Chippoka) increasing pirate and diplomacy rewards, tweaked down values and restored tech
			Added Spy Disappearances (Chippoka) eliminates the diplo penalty for killing when a spy is caught
			Eliminated Stronger Fortifications (CREDIT) since TacticalMod 3.4 tweaks HP already (not quite 2x) and is more comprehensive
			Eliminated PerkPoints15 794294890 (CREDIT) since UCP ups Perks to 20 and BigRedz CustomRace Tweaks ups to 25
01-Apr-2023 Cleanup and document and reupload to Steam Workshop
03-Apr-2023 Renamed files to clearly show which mod they come from (at least for the non-trivial ones)
			Tweaked Anomaly rewards for a more smooth progression and to allow discoveries as early as turn 5 to give something other than just a Scout
			Added Realistic Minor Civilizations 2086260302 (CREDIT) and corrected mispelling of gaia as gaya so Farmer system has a chance at gaia worlds
			Uploaded this and all my other mods in-progress to public Github https://github.com/spadesmaster/MOO_BigRedzMods
04-Apr-2023 Added Xtra Capitols and Xtra Custom 4X (ADD DESCRIPTION)
08-Apr-2023 Playtested in two games uploading to Steam Workshop

			


TODO: 		Add fix for Tactical Mod 3.4 RaceTypes contains multiple documents, this method will return only the first?
			Add fix for AI Galaxies in-game Exception (by removing all the non-English localizations) - modified in mod's own directory for now
			Split out my favorite tweaks to a separate mod to narrow down errors and allow people to opt-in for those separately
