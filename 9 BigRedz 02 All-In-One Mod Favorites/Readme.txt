BigRedz 01 All-In-One Mod Favorites with Tweaks

Mod MUST BE LOADED LAST IN YOUR MOD ORDER to override/correct any previous' mods changes
It should also be loaded before BigRedz' other mods (the 01 shows you the load order within my own mods)

Tired of having so many tiny tweak mods cluttering your mod list?
Tired of having to fuss with the mod load order to get your game to work properly?
Not sure which of the popular old mods are no longer necessary/compatible with 5X/UCP/DSMP/TacticalMod?
Tired of casual mod developers overwriting/breaking other mods?
Want a clean updated version for each of your favorite tweak mods?

Complete list of mods included (or eliminated as unneccesary) and Change history below

29-Mar-2023 Created, custom race perk points to 25 (5 more than 5X), tweaked both ship/structure scrapping to 75% of original cost
			Added Speed Mod (vaaish) for faster ship/gate travel with expansion to support all 5X engines and tweaked values
30-Mar-2023 Added Battle Pods Revert (Mituna) for no cargo space cost pods but a little more expensive
			Added Both Tectonic (Mituna) so you get both critical endgame techs Core Mine and Core Dump even if not Creative
			Added Only Good Random Events (Mituna) which prevents bad events (is it still allowing Good ones?)
			Added Pollution Structs Boost (Mituna) which makes pollution structures a little more effective
			Added AI Cant Ignore (Spuds) so you can still try diplomacy with a race that doesn't like you
			Added Planet Max Pop +4 (Num7) which increases the max population limit on ALL size planets by 4
			Added Nerfed Antarans (BigRedz) which allows Antaran attacks but makes early ones much easier
			Added Outposts Anywhere (Steel) allows military outposts and jump gates to be built even in systems we haven't yet colonized a planet in for more strategic map control
			Added Rewards and Diplomacy Tweaks (Chippoka) increasing pirate and diplomacy rewards, tweaked down values and restored tech
			Added Spy Disappearances (Chippoka) eliminates the diplo penalty for killing when a spy is caught
			Eliminated Stronger Fortifications (CREDIT) since TacticalMod 3.4 tweaks HP already (not quite 2x) and is more comprehensive
			Eliminated PerkPoints15 794294890 (CREDIT) since UCP ups Perks to 20 and BigRedz CustomRace Tweaks ups to 25
