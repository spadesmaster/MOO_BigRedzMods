Colony Bases v1.5 - 5X/UCP/Split Tech Tree

Colony Bases v1.5. 5X, UCP, 5X UCP Comp, and 5X Split Tech Tree compatible (all are required for this mod). Load this mod at the end of your other mods. Requires starting a new game.

Do you miss colony bases from MOO2 like I do? This mod creates a new 'Sublight Colony Ship.' This ship is ideal for colonizing planets within a solar system. The lower hull/structure requirements for sublight travel, and less expensive engine, make building this ship much less costly than colony ships that are capable of faster-than-light travel. While interstellar travel with this drive is possible, it will be many generations before the nearest star is reached.

This ship greatly reduces the time required for the expansion phase of the game, getting you to the exploitation, extermination and expropriation phases faster.

My only disappointment with this mod is that the AI has no idea how to use these ships. It builds them and colonizes within the system, but then also sends them to other systems, getting them trapped in warp lanes. If they send an escort fleet with the ship to the next system, that fleet is trapped for 200+ turns, wasting AI resources. I therefore limited this new ship to human players, not the AI. As this provides quite the advantage to the human player, I strongly recommend increasing the difficulty level of the AI to keep the game exciting.

I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement. And, a special thanks to The Great One, Spud, for his helpful tips.
