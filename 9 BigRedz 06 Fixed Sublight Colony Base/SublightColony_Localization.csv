SHIP_TYPE_SUBLIGHT_COLONY_DESCRIPTION,,"Sublight Colony Ships are ideal for colonizing planets within a system. The lower hull requirements for sublight travel and less expensive engine make building this ship much less costly than colony ships capable of faster-than-light travel. While interstellar travel with this drive is possible, it will be very slow (25% of a base ion drive).  Colony ships are specialized vessels that along with bringing an initial population, upon landing, the ship itself breaks apart into the following modules that function as the fully operational buildings of discovered technologies - Marine Barracks, Automated Factory, Geosynchronic Warehouse, Research Laboratory, Hydroponic Farm, Colony Base, Global DNA Scanner, Holo Simulator & Pollution Processor. Total Day 1 Upkeep if all prefabricated building modules are present is 13 %Credits.",,,,,,,,,,,
